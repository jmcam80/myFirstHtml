                    As a guild officer, I was in charge of ensuring that raiders watched training videos,
                    they were properly equipped as well as they had the proper items in their inventory. 
                    The reaon for this is we would spend several hours raiding, and if you aren't prepared
                    it may kill the person next to you, or even the whole group. If we didn't want an exercise
                    in futility, some before care is needed.

                            While serving in the Army, I trained in various medical facilities within the states
                            and while deployed over seas. I passed my EMT National Certification, for the second time,
                            while serving in Kosovo, at Camp Bondsteel.
